            <p> 
                    There are a few competitons behind me, unfortunately I didn't finished in the top level, 
                    but all of the competitions was new for me, I did the aeropress championship in 2016 in Hungary, 
                    where I finished in the semi-finals. In 2018 I was on the stage of the coffee masters in London, 
                    where I would like to be in this year as well, but now with higher knowledge, less nervous and more focused. 
                    Also in 2018 I was on the UK Latte art championship for 2019, which was also a good experience. In this year there are 
                    3 competitions where I would liket to attend, The coffee masters London, Latte art, and the UK aeropress.

        <p>
                Last year I was presenting The Paradise, but now, after a year, so many things have happened to me. And now London has become my 
                'Burning Heaven'. I have put all my feelings for the city into this drink, the sweet and sour happiness, and the slow burning pain.
                All of this makes a fantastically warm winterish taste drink, because the weather in London, most of the time, is as cold as my ex's heart.

        <h1>The recipe</h1>
        
        <p>
                This drink starts with a tea-coffee infusion made with a syphon, using a vanilla flavoured English breakfast tea, 
                and for the coffee I chose a washed process Burundi, which gives a nice toffee flavour. 
                (Any coffee with a toffee, chocolate, or caramel flavour can be used.) I put the tea into the bottom chamber, 
                filled it up with hot water, lit the burner and waited. Once the water moved to the top vessel, I added the coffee, 
                left it for a minute, then turned off the heat and waited until the coffee went back to the tea. 
        </p>
        <p>
                At the same time, I put some ice into a shaker, along with some Mr Black coffee Liqueur, sugar syrup, and a few dashs of chili sauce. 
                I gave it a good shake, and double strained it into a shot glass which had a sugar decoration on it. 
        </p>    
        <p>    
                When the tea-coffee infusion is ready, I strained it over the cold ingredients, and it created a nice warm drink that 
                you can drink immediately. Then the choice is yours, you can drink this as shot, or just drink it slowly and gently.
